Once completed, share it with the appropriate team members as needed. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a Google Sheet and organize the data: \n1. Sign in to your Google account.\n2. Navigate to Google Sheets by clicking on the link or searching for it using the search bar in your browser.\n3. Click on the '+' button to create a new blank spreadsheet.\n4. Rename the sheet as 'Q2 Sales Tracker'.\n5. To add columns, click on the small square icon at the top of column A and choose the desired columns.\n6. Add the labels for each column (Product Name, Quantity Sold, Sale Price, Total Revenue, Tax, Net Revenue, Profit Margin, and Notes) as mentioned earlier.\n7. To fill in the data for each sale, simply click on the appropriate cell and type in the relevant information.\n8. To calculate total revenue, tax, net revenue, profit margin, you can use formulas. For example: \n- Total Revenue = Quantity Sold * Sale Price\n- Tax = (Total Revenue * Tax Percentage) / 100\n- Net Revenue = Total Revenue - Tax\n- Profit Margin = (Net Revenue / Total Revenue) * 100\n9. Share the document with your team members as needed by clicking on 'Share' and entering their email addresses.\n10. Regularly update the sheet with new sales data for accurate tracking of Q2 sales performance."

The overall equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, where water is split and electrons are passed through a series of electron carriers to produce ATP and NADPH; and the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules using the energy stored in ATP and NADPH. In addition to producing glucose for their own use, plants release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which is essential for most forms of life on Earth. Photosynthesis is vital not only for the survival of these organisms but also for the global carbon cycle and climate regulation."

For American football, you might want to check out NFL.com, and for baseball, MLB.com would be a good place to start.
