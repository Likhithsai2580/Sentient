- Chat history: Recent chat messages with the user.

Based on this, generate:

- Memory operations: Add, update, or delete memories based on the new emails (e.g., remember a contact, update meeting details). The operation type (`add`, `update`, `delete`) is implied by the context; just provide the `text` for the memory.
- Messages: Message to send to the user to inform them about the new emails or ask for further actions.

Consider the user's current context, ongoing tasks, and chat history to make relevant suggestions. Focus on actionable items and important updates.
