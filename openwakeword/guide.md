Okay, let's see. The user wants a full implementation of their wake word detection code using openWakeWord and webrtcvad. They provided a code snippet but need the complete version with microphone handling and model setup.

First, I need to recall how openWakeWord works. From the search results, openWakeWord is an open-source framework for wake word detection. The user's code initializes the Model with "hey_sentient" as the wake word model, but they might need to train this model first. Wait, in the previous answer, there was mention of training a custom model using synthetic data. But in the current code, maybe they expect a pre-trained model?

Looking at the search result [6], openWakeWord allows training custom models via Colab notebooks. So if "hey_sentient" isn't a default model, the user needs to create it. But the user's code uses it directly. Hmm, maybe they have a custom model already. Alternatively, perhaps the example uses a placeholder, and I should include steps to train or load the model.

The code uses webrtcvad for voice activity detection. The VAD is set to aggressive mode (3). The audio chunks must be 16-bit PCM, 16kHz, 30ms frames as per webrtcvad's requirements.

The user's existing code lacks the microphone stream implementation. The function get_microphone_stream() is a placeholder. So I need to add that using pyaudio or sounddevice. From the search results, [1] and [7] show examples using pyaudio.

In search result [1], there's a code example using pyaudio to capture audio and process it with openwakeword. The format is paInt16, 16000 Hz, 1 channel, and frames*per_buffer set to 3000 (which is 16000 * 0.1875 = 3000 samples for 187.5ms). Wait, but webrtcvad requires 10, 20, or 30 ms frames. So 30ms would be 480 samples (16000 \_ 0.03). But in [1], they use 3000 samples which is 187.5ms per frame. That might not align with VAD's requirements.

Wait, webrtcvad processes frames of 10, 20, or 30 ms. So for 30ms frames at 16kHz, each frame is 480 samples (16000 \* 0.03). So the microphone stream should read in chunks of 480 samples each.

But in the user's code, they have a loop over frames from get_microphone_stream(). So I need to set up pyaudio with a chunk size of 480 samples.

However, in search result [1], their example uses 3000 samples per frame (which is longer than 30ms). Maybe that's because openwakeword can handle longer frames but VAD needs shorter ones. Hmm.

Wait, the VAD processes each frame of 30ms. So even if the audio is read in larger chunks, we need to split them into 30ms frames for VAD processing.

Alternatively, set pyaudio's frames_per_buffer to 480 (30ms) so each read gives exactly one frame for VAD.

But then openWakeWord might require longer audio chunks for prediction. For example, in [6], it says that openWakeWord models process audio in overlapping windows of about 1 second.

So there might be a discrepancy between VAD frame size and openWakeWord's required input size.

Wait, looking at search result [6], under Model Architecture: "For openWakeWord models are composed of three separate components: melspectrogram pre-processing, feature extraction backbone model..." So maybe the input to openWakeWord is longer than individual VAD frames.

This suggests that while VAD operates on small frames (30ms), openWakeWord requires longer audio segments (like multiple frames) for prediction.

So perhaps the approach is:

- Capture audio in chunks (e.g., using pyaudio with a buffer size that allows accumulating enough data for openWakeWord).

- Use VAD to filter out non-speech chunks.

- Buffer multiple VAD-positive frames to form an input window for openWakeWord.

But how does this fit into the existing code?

In the user's code snippet, process_audio takes an audio_chunk (a frame) and applies VAD. If speech is detected, passes it to oww.predict(). But according to [6], openWakeWord expects "audio data containing 16-bit 16khz PCM audio data... For best efficiency and latency, audio frames should be multiples of 80 ms".

Wait, so maybe each call to oww.predict() should have an audio frame of at least 80ms (1280 samples). But if we're reading in 30ms chunks (480 samples), perhaps we need to buffer those until we have enough samples for an openWakeWord prediction.

Alternatively, maybe openWakeWord can handle any length but performs better with certain sizes.

In any case, there might be a mismatch between VAD frame size and what openWakeWord expects.

So perhaps in the implementation:

- Use pyaudio to read in larger chunks (e.g., 80ms) which can be split into VAD frames of 30ms each.

But this complicates things.

Alternatively, read in small chunks (30ms), apply VAD on each chunk, buffer speech segments into a larger buffer that's then fed into openWakeWord periodically.

But this requires handling buffering and ensuring that when speech is detected by VAD, enough data is collected for openWakeWord's processing.

Alternatively, use overlapping windows or continuous buffering.

This could get complicated. To keep it simple as per the user's original code snippet:

They have process_audio take each frame (assuming each frame is a single chunk from the microphone) and apply VAD on it. If speech is detected, pass that same chunk to oww.predict(). But according to [6], "audio frames should be multiples of 80 ms", so if each chunk from the microphone is only 30ms (480 samples), then passing that directly may not be sufficient for accurate predictions.

Therefore, perhaps adjust the microphone stream to capture larger chunks that meet both VAD and openWakeWord requirements.

Wait, but how?

Another approach: Use a ring buffer that accumulates audio data. For every incoming chunk (say 30ms), add it to the buffer. Then every time step (e.g., every chunk), take the last N ms from the buffer as input to openWakeWord.

For example: if openWakeWord requires at least 800ms of audio for prediction (as some models might), then keep a buffer of the last second of audio and feed that into oww.predict() whenever there's speech activity detected by VAD in recent chunks.

But integrating this with webrtcvad would require checking each incoming chunk for speech presence and then feeding appropriate segments into oww.

Alternatively, since webrtcvad checks individual small frames but openWakeWord needs longer segments for context, perhaps accumulate multiple consecutive speech frames before passing them to oww.predict().

This complicates things but may improve accuracy.

However, given that the user provided code passes individual frames through both VAD and oww.predict(), perhaps their setup assumes that oww can handle small chunks but it's more efficient with larger ones.

Looking at search result [6], under Model Architecture: "The models are composed of three separate components: melspectrogram pre-processing...". The feature extraction backbone converts melspectrogram inputs into embeddings which are then used by individual wake word models. This suggests that perhaps each prediction call processes an entire window of audio (e.g., one second) but overlapping windows are processed incrementally.

But regardless of that complexity, I need to implement what the user asked: full implementation with microphone stream and model setup based on their initial code snippet.

So steps needed:

1. Install required packages: webrtcvad, openwakeword, numpy, pyaudio or sounddevice.
2. Set up PyAudio to capture audio from microphone in correct format (16kHz mono).
3. Implement get_microphone_stream() function.
4. Handle model initialization correctly.
5. Process each audio frame through VAD.
6. If speech detected by VAD pass frame to oww.predict().
   7 Check prediction score against threshold.
   8 Trigger action when threshold exceeded.

Looking at search result [1], there's an example using pyaudio with format paInt16, channels=1 rate=16000 and frames_per_buffer=3000 samples which corresponds to ~187ms per frame (3000/16000 =0.1875 seconds). But this may not align with webrtcvad's requirement of exact multiples of10/20/30 ms frames.

Wait webrtcvad requires that each frame must be exactly10/20/30 ms long at sample rates supported by it(8k or16k). For example:

At16kHz sample rate:

-10 ms frame =160 samples

-20 ms=320

-30 ms=480

Thus when using webrtcvad.Vad(3), each audio chunk passed into vad.is_speech must be exactly one of these lengths.

In user’s code:

The function process_audio takes an 'audio_chunk' which must be converted into bytes compatible with webrtcvad.is_speech(). In their code:

if vad.is_speech(audio_chunk.tobytes(),16000):

So 'audio_chunk' must be int16 numpy array with length corresponding to one of these supported durations.

Thus when capturing from microphone via PyAudio:

Each read should return exactly480 samples (for30 ms).

Thus setting PyAudio stream with:

format=pyaudio.paInt16,

channels=1,

rate=16000,

frames_per_buffer=480,

input=True

Then each call to stream.read(480) will give30 ms of audio data.

Now integrating this into user’s code:

The loop would read480 sample chunks from PyAudio.

But then passing these directly into oww.Model.predict(audio_chunk).

However according to search result [6], "For best efficiency and latency audio frames should be multiples of80 ms". Thus processing every30 ms may not be optimal but still possible.

Moreover in search result [6]'s example:

frame = my_function_to_get_audio_frame()

prediction = model.predict(frame)

Where 'frame' could be variable length.

Thus assuming oww.Model can handle variable length inputs but performance may vary.

Putting all together:

Full implementation steps:

1 Import required modules:webrtcvad、openwakeword、pyaudio、numpy、etc.

2 Initialize Vad(3) and oww.Model(wakeword_model="hey_sentient").

But wait，the wakeword_model parameter expects path tflite or onnx models? In search result[6], models can be loaded via providing paths，but also default models are available.

Wait，the user’s code initializes Model(wakeword_model="hey_sentient")，but unless they have trained their own model named 'hey_sentient', this would not work.

Ah，this indicates that they have created a custom wake word model named 'hey_sentient'. How?

From search result[6]，training new models involves using synthetic data generation via Colab notebooks，so users can create their own wake words.

Assuming they've trained their own model，but since this step isn't part of current question，the answer should include either instructions on training or use default models.

But given their previous messages，they want 'Hey Sentient' as wake word，so likely needing custom model training.

However，the current question focuses on full implementation given their existing code snippet which uses 'hey_sentient' as wakeword_model parameter.

Thus，if 'hey_sentient.onnx' exists in appropriate directory，then Model(wakeword_models=["path/to/hey_sentient.onnx"]) would work.

Alternatively，if using default models like 'alexa' etc., but since they want 'Hey Sentient', need custom model.

Therefore，in full implementation，need instructions on how to generate or obtain 'hey_sentient.onnx' model file.

From search result[1]，there’s a simplified version where you can generate your own ONNX model using provided notebook.

Thus steps would include：

- Training custom wake word model using Colab notebook from dscripka/openwakeword repository（simplified version）

Once trained，save as 'hey_sentient.onnx' and load via Model(wakeword_models=["path/to/hey_sentient.onnx"]）

Assuming user has done this，the full implementation would use that path.

But since user hasn't mentioned training steps，maybe provide placeholder path or instructions within comments.

Alternatively，use one of default models like 'alexa' for testing purposes.

But given their requirement for 'Hey Sentient', better guide them through generating custom model first.

However，the current query asks for full implementation including microphone stream etc., so focus on coding part assuming model exists.

Now integrating all parts：

Import necessary libraries：

import webrtcvad

from openwakeword.model import Model

import numpy as np

import pyaudio

Initialize components：

vad = webrtcvad.Vad(3)

oww_model = Model(wakeword_models=["path/to/hey_sentient.onnx"], inference_framework="onnx")

Set up PyAudio：

FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16

CHANNELS =1

RATE =16000

FRAMES_PER_BUFFER =480 #30 ms

p =pyaudio.PyAudio()

stream =p.open(

format=FORMAT,

channels=CHANNELS,

rate=RATE,

input=True,

frames_per_buffer=FRAMES_PER_BUFFER

)

Then loop reading frames：

while True:

    raw_audio = stream.read(FRAMES_PER_BUFFER)

    audio_frame = np.frombuffer(raw_audio,dtype=np.int16)

    # Process through VAD

    if vad.is_speech(audio_frame.tobytes(), RATE):

        prediction = oww_model.predict(audio_frame)

        if prediction.get("hey_sentient",0) >0.85:

            trigger_action()

But wait：openwakeword.Model.predict() expects input as numpy array？Yes according examples like [1].

In [1], they do：

audio = np.frombuffer(mic_stream.read(3000), dtype=np.int16)

prediction =model.predict(audio)

So yes，passing numpy array directly.

However，each call topredict() processes one frame which may not give accurate results since wake word detection typically requires context over multiple time steps.

Therefore，openWakeWord might internally handle buffering previous audio data for context-aware predictions。

According todocumentation in[6]:

"The models maintain internal state/buffers so subsequent calls topredict() will automatically consider previous audio data when making predictions."

Thus even if processing small chunks（e.g.,30ms），the predict() function considers historical context。

This means even processing small chunks could work because internally stateful buffers accumulate necessary context。

Thus implementation can proceed as per user’s original snippet：process each small chunk through vad filter then pass valid ones topredict()；trigger action when confidence exceeds threshold。

Putting all together：

Full Code Implementation：

import webrtcvad

from openwakeword.model import Model

import numpy as np

import pyaudio

import time

def trigger_action():

    print("Wake word detected!")

    # Launch Electron app here

# Initialize components

vad = webrtcvad.Vad(3) # Aggressive filtering

# Load custom wake word model（replace path）

oww_model = Model(

    wakeword_models=["models/hey_sentient.onnx"],

    inference_framework="onnx"

)

# Audio settings compatible with WebRTCVAD

FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16

CHANNELS =1

RATE =16000 # Sample rate must be either8k or16k

FRAME_DURATION_MS=30 # Must be10/20/30 ms for WebRTCVAD

FRAME_SIZE=int(RATE \* FRAME_DURATION_MS /1000) # Samples per frame：480

# Initialize microphone stream

p=pyaudio.PyAudio()

stream=p.open(

    format=FORMAT,

    channels=CHANNELS,

    rate=RATE,

    input=True,

    frames_per_buffer=FRAME_SIZE,

)

print("Listening for 'Hey Sentient'...")

try:

    while True:

        # Read audio frame from mic

        raw_audio=stream.read(FRAME_SIZE)

        audio_frame=np.frombuffer(raw_audio,dtype=np.int16)


        # Check if frame contains speech via WebRTCVAD

        if vad.is_speech(audio_frame.tobytes(), RATE):

            # Get prediction from OpenWakeWord

            predictions=oww_model.predict(audio_frame)

            hey_sentient_score=predictions.get("hey_sentient",0)


            # Check confidence threshold

            if hey_sentient_score >0.85:

                trigger_action()

                # Optional cooldown period after detection

                time.sleep(2)

except KeyboardInterrupt:

    print("Stopping...")

finally:

    stream.stop_stream()

    stream.close()

    p.terminate()

Notes：

- Replace"models/hey_sentient.onnx"with actual path totrained ONNX model.
- Adjust confidence threshold（0.85）based on testing.
- Add cooldown period after detection toprevent multiple triggers.
- Error handling omitted for brevity；consider adding exceptions handling.
- Ensure dependencies are installed：pip install webrtcvad openwakeword numpy pyaudio

Training Custom Wake Word：

To create "Hey Sentient"model：

1 Use Google Colab notebook from dscripka/openwakeword-simplified ([1])：

- Generate synthetic voice samples using TTS（Text-to-Speech）with variations.
- Train ONNX model via provided notebook.
- Save trained model as hey_sentient.onnx.

2 Place trained ONNX files in project directory under /models/.

Performance Optimization：

- Implement noise suppression（e.g.,RNNoise）preprocessing.
- Adjust confidence thresholds dynamically based on ambient noise levels.
- Use threading/asyncio fornblocking mic input processing.
